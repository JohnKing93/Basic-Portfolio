                Hi, I'm Johnny! I'm a Salesforce consultant working out of Atlanta, GA. 
                In my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends, getting outdoors, keeping up with a few TV shows, and learning new things. 
                </p>
                <p>        
                I'm taking this class so I can learn about how to build modern web applications. I'd like to be able to communicate between systems and build applications that process data and extend the functionality in Salesforce.
                It would be could to eventually learn how to build mobile applications or learn back end languages like Java.
                </p>
                <p>       
                Something iteresting about me is that I love to cook! I usually eat pretty healthy too. On of my aspirations is to open a restuarant later in life (it would sabotage my plan if I told you what kind). I also have a cat
                (named Kitty) and she's very sweet and vocal. That's all for now, but I'll update this again soon!
